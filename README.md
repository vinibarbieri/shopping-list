# Listly - Shopping List Application

A modern and intuitive shopping list web application that helps you manage your weekly shopping items efficiently.

## About the Project

Listly is a shopping list application developed with a focus on simplicity, efficiency, and a clean, intuitive user experience. This project was intentionally built without using any frameworks or external libraries, utilizing only pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal was to consolidate and deepen my knowledge of web development fundamentals, understanding how DOM manipulation works, CSS styling, and building responsive and interactive interfaces without relying on abstractions.

Beyond reinforcing my JavaScript knowledge, this project also aimed to practice good code structuring practices, style organization, HTML semantics, and the creation of consistent visual components, such as fully CSS-styled buttons, inputs, and checkboxes. All of this was designed to create a pleasant, modern, and functional interface that works perfectly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Developing this project from scratch, without frameworks, was an intentional choice to strengthen my mastery of fundamental web technologies before applying or diving deeper into more advanced tools and libraries.
